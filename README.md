# üí´ About Me:

üöÄ Alexander Rowshan | Computer Science Undergrad @ USC Viterbi | Aspiring Software Engineer

Hello! My name is Alex. I‚Äôm a Junior Computer Science at the University of Southern California with a minor in Artificial Intelligence Applications, My academic journey is enriched with advanced coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, iOS App Development, among many others.

Projects
StudySC: Developed a collaborative study web application that simplifies study group formation for the university community, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS for the frontend, and Java with Spring Boot for the backend, integrated with MySQL for efficient data management.

Digital Green Screen Background Image Replacer: Developed a precise C++ algorithm that detects and eliminates green screen backgrounds in images by leveraging chroma key values and implements background replacement functionality through pixel manipulation techniques.

Optical Character Recognition: Created a program that reads and identifies numbers in images of varying fonts and sizes, utilizing image processing techniques, a breadth-first search algorithm with a queue data structure, and identification methods such as symmetry and aspect ratio.

Functional Retail System Based on Amazon Product Dataset: Programmed a system that includes a user interface simulating Amazon functionality, applies skills in database management, derived classes, and parsing, and utilizes data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage and process data.

What I'm currently working on:

BrainBet: A full-stack web application using React and Spring Boot, enabling users to create and join groups, wager money on trivia games, and experience unique, ChatGPT-generated questions. 

National Park Service Web App: Currently working on a sophisticated web app that helps users explore and learn about popular US national parks, assisting them in choosing the most suitable park to visit with friends. The app prioritizes security, protects private information, and provides an accessible user interface for all users, including those with disabilities.
